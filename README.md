# SFMLPlayground
Just messing around with SFML. Note that this repo uses SFML 2.5.1 (check out https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php for the latest version), and expects it to be in `C:\SFML-2.5.1`. If you're using a newer version, you'll need to update the VS project properties and copy new DLLs into the project folder.
